## 2025-02-18 - Custom Regex Sanitization Risks
**Vulnerability:** The codebase used a custom regex-based implementation (`lib/security/sanitize-html.ts`) for HTML sanitization, which is fragile and prone to XSS bypasses (e.g. unquoted attributes).
**Learning:** Developers often underestimate the complexity of HTML parsing. Relying on custom regex creates a false sense of security.
**Prevention:** Always use established, battle-tested libraries like `isomorphic-dompurify` for HTML sanitization. Ensure `jsdom` is added as a production dependency for `isomorphic-dompurify` to work correctly in SSR environments.
