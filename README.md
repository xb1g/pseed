Most career guidance tells students what jobs exist. PassionSeed lets them **try the work**.

Students don't pick a career from a list — they spend days inside simulated ones. They interview professionals (AI-facilitated, real humans behind the curriculum), build actual products in 5-day hackathons, and figure out what "I want to be a data scientist" actually feels like before they commit years to it.

Built in Thailand, for Thai students first. Bilingual throughout.

## What's inside

**Learning Maps** — Node-based learning paths with real content and assessments. Students unlock the next node by finishing the last, like a skill tree for a career.

**Hackathons** — Our flagship. 5-day team events where students build health-tech products that real judges score. Past teams shipped air-quality monitors, preventive-health tools, and more. [See what they built →](https://www.passionseed.org/hackathon/gallery)

**Expert Interviews** — Structured career conversations with professionals, guided by AI so every student gets a deep interview, not whoever raised their hand.

**Direction Finder** — An AI recommender that matches students to paths based on how they actually work, not a personality quiz.

**Classrooms** — Instructors get join codes, team management, and progress dashboards. Students get structure without babysitting.

## The design system

Students and experts see different skies:

- **Dawn** — student-facing. Cool blues warming into gold. Optimistic, exploratory.
- **Dusk** — expert-facing. Deep violets cooling into amber. Warm, authoritative.

Both share the same DNA: fluid, luminous components that respond like living things. Full spec in [docs/ui-design-system.md](docs/ui-design-system.md).

## Running it locally

You'll need Node.js 20+, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), and the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).

```bash
pnpm install                      # dependencies
./scripts/setup-local-secrets.sh  # creates .env.local
npx supabase start                # local database
pnpm dev                          # dev server on :3000
```

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm build` | Production build |
| `pnpm test` | Jest tests |
| `pnpm lint` | ESLint |

## For contributors

A few house rules that will save you a code review round-trip:

- **Auth:** we use `@supabase/ssr` with `getAll()`/`setAll()` cookie methods only. See `utils/supabase/server.ts` for the pattern — please copy it exactly.
- **Queries:** all database access goes through `lib/supabase/`. Don't query Supabase from components directly.
- **Migrations:** additive and idempotent only (`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, nullable columns). They apply straight to production.
- **Design:** Dawn is for students, Dusk is for experts, and glow animations animate `clip-path` + `opacity` + `filter` together. The rules live in `docs/ui-design-system.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
